# Problem statement: predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features.
## About Dataset
  The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine. The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature 
  and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables.

  Attribute Information:

  The explanations of sensor measurements and their brief statistics are given below.
